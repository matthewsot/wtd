# goal
Basically a big list of tasks, organized into days. Tasks can be tagged with
times (@9AM, @10AM+2hr, @9:45AM--11AM etc.), and with arbitrary tags (+public,
+busy, +weekly, etc.).
- `wtd carryover` finds `+weekly` tags from the current week and copies those
  events to the upcoming week.
- `wtd publish` publishes a calendar on my website showing my availability
